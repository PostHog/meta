_This template is a starting point for your bi-annual career check ins, but feel free to edit as you feel is most helpful for your meetings!_

_To get the most out of this session, you should suggest your team member goes round and collects feedback to help guide this conversation from their colleagues. Scheduling these right after a 360 feedback session at an offsite is a great time to do this._

### [INSERT DATE]

**Skills**

- What have you been wanting to learn more of?
- One year from now, ideally, what kinds of skills do you want to become better at, or projects do you hope you will have taken on?
- What parts of your role do you most and least enjoy?
- What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses?
  - Follow up: do you want to prioritize leaning into your strengths further or addressing your weaknesses?
- Is there an area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?

**Goals**

- What do you want to be when you grow up?
- Whose career do you admire?
- If you could design your ideal role at PostHog, what would it look like?
- Are there any goals or aspirations you've set for yourself in the next 1-2 years?
- How can I support you as a manager in reaching those goals? How can PostHog support you in reaching those goals?

Pro tip: keep the questions and these next steps separate - it's usually better to schedule a follow up conversation to cover next steps, rather than responding in the moment, as your followups will be more thoughtful. 

**Next steps**

This can be anything, but you can consider things like:

- Finding opportunities to push them outside their comfort zone (in the right direction)
- Sharing feedback and advice to help them improve on their weaknesses
- Pairing them with team members who are strong in certain areas to grow their strengths further
- "[Give away your legos](https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups)" - actively push your team to take on more responsibility
- Help find them an external mentor
