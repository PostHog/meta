_This template is a starting point for your quarterly career check ins, but feel free to edit as you feel is most helpful for your meetings!_

_You can also add any of these questions to any relevant performance reviews if you like - it makes sense to combine the performance review and this career check if they are scheduled very closely to each other, for example._

### [INSERT DATE]

**Skills**

- What have you been wanting to learn more of?
- One year from now, ideally, what kinds of skills do you want to become better at, or projects do you hope you will have taken on?
- What parts of your role do you most and least enjoy?
- What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses?
  - Follow up: do you want to prioritize leaning into your strengths further or addressing your weaknesses?
- Is there an area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?

**Goals**

- What do you want to be when you grow up?
- Whose career do you admire?
- If you could design your ideal role at PostHog, what would it look like?
- Are there any goals or aspirations you've set for yourself in the next 1-2 years?
- How can I support you as a manager in reaching those goals? How can PostHog support you in reaching those goals?

**Next steps**

This can be anything, but you should consider things like:

- Finding opportunities to push them outside their comfort zone (in the right direction)
- Sharing feedback and advice to help them improve on their weaknesses
- Pairing them with team members who are strong in certain areas to grow their strengths further
- "[Give away your legos](https://review.firstround.com/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups)" - actively push your team to take on more responsibility
- Help find them an external mentor
