# Messaging

### Context
_What are we sending and why?_

### Format
_Is this a broadcast, or campaign? From Workflows, or Customer.io?_

### Audience / Targeting
_Who will see it?_

### Boring organization bit
- [ ] I've added this to [The Messaging Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_7ed0dfed00c9a18dbf04d93e633a974f2f2e5172f00673aba3fdb2957baff521%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) with a link to this issue

### Requested input and previews
_Dump screenshots here and tag for feedback if needed._
