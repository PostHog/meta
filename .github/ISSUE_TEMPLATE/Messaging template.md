_A short statement explaining what has led to this campaign or customer messaging. Is it a service message, an upsell, an experiment, an onboarding flow? Put that here. _

### Goal
_What is the primary goal or metric you are trying to leverage? If there isn't one, will you track clicks, UTMs, open rates?_

### Format
_What mediums is this campaign or messaging going to span? Which platforms will you use to deliver the messaging?_

### Audience / Targeting
_Where are we rolling this experiment and who will see it?_

### Resources, timeline, responsibilities
_Is this a single message, or a longer campaign? Are multiple people working on it? Who's doing what, when? A checklist solves everything._

### Requested input
_Are there any outstanding questions, potential blockers, or feedback you need? Spell it out._

### Previews
_Got previews of the copy, the emails, the content? Shove them here._
