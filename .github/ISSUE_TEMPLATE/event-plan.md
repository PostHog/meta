## Discovery 
Ask these questions to determine what specific tasks PostHog might need to do: 
- **People:** Are PostHog people needed in person? What level, role or skill? 
- **Asks of the people:** Will there be a talk? Networking? Demos? Participation?
- **Goods/merch:** Will physical objects (shirts, giveaways, signage) be needed?
- **Social media:** What kind of co-promoting is expected?
- **Artwork and branding:** Are unique, custom assets needed?
- **Online support:** Will live and realtime support or communication be needed during the event?
- **Communication:** In-house at PostHog, and beyond, what needs to be shared? 
- **Travel:** Is travel going to be part of it? Who, when, where, how? 
- **Timeline:** When is it happening, and when do we need all this by?
