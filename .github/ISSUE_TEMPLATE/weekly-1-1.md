_This template is a starting point for your weekly 1-1s, but feel free to edit as you feel is most helpful for your meetings! You may find it simpler to just have one agenda that both of you contribute to._

_The purpose of the first 2 sections is to make sure you are both aligned, and to let managers give as much context as possible. The third section is deliberately open-ended - sometimes you will want to work through a specific problem, other times you may have a proposal or idea you want to discuss, or feedback to share._

_Every ~3 months, you should swap your regular 1-1 out for a career development check in._
