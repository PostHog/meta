# PostHog/meta

This is a place to discuss non-product issues in public.

For product discussions, please see the [posthog/posthog](https://github.com/posthog/posthog) repo.

For example:

- marketing topics such as ideas for new content
- dev rel topics for campaigns, that don't fit into posthog/posthog.com or the posthog/posthog repo
- random ideas for how PostHog works internally
