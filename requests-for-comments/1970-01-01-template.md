# Request for comments: TITLE & OWNER

## Problem statement
*Who are we building for, what are their needs (include example cases), why is this important?*

## Success criteria
*How do we know if this is successful (i.e. metrics, customer feedback), what's out of scope, whats makes this ambitious?*

##Â Context
*What are our competitors doing, what are the technical constraints, what are customers asking for, what does the data tell us, are there external motivations (e.g. launch week, enterprise contract)?*

## Design 
*What are the key user experience and technical design decisions / trade-offs?*

## Sprints
*How do we break this into discrete and valuable chunks for the folks shipping it? How do we ensure it's high quality and fast?*
