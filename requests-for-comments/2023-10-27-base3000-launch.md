# Base 3000 & Notebooks launch

We want to launch the ‘first version’ of PostHog 3000 after the next sprint, which means the week starting November 13th (+ 1 week if needed). We have decided to **include Notebooks** in this launch, so that we can have a big launch that combines functionality and design changes.

## Scope for launch

- Dark Mode
- Base 3000 [Check this mega issue for details](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/18089)
