# Base 3000 & Notebooks launch

We want to launch the ‘first version’ of PostHog 3000 after the next sprint, which means the week starting November 13th (+ 1 week if needed). We have decided to **include Notebooks** in this launch, so that we can have a big launch that combines functionality and design changes.

## Scope for launch

- Dark Mode
- Base 3000 [Check this mega issue for details](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/18089)

## Pre-launch evaluation

We decided that even the "base" version has enough major changes that we want to test that it both doesn't impact our key metrics negatively as well as (if possible) evaluate if it is overall an improvement, especially with new users.
This might be hard to do or to get clear signals for whether it is an improvement (especially as it is only a step along the way to the end goal UI/UX).

- [ ] **Signup/onboarding Experiment**: _just_ for the onboarding we could experiment with the styles separate from the rest of the app
  - [ ] **Metrics**: Same as usual onboarding metrics?
  - [ ] Important that we keep the style consistent from signup through to app usage as otherwise it will be a janky experience
  - [ ] We mostly care about **negatively** impacting the flow
- [ ] **General Experiment**: in combination with internal testing we could start to roll out the product to new and existing users as an experiment
  - [ ] Important that we keep the style consistent from signup through to app usage as otherwise it will be a janky experience
  - [ ] We originally opted against being able to go back to the old UI - do we want to offer this?
  - [ ] **Metrics**:
    - [ ] Same as onboarding?
    - [ ] Retention over time (what time frame do we need to be clear on this?)
    - [ ] Number of clicks on the sidebar as a negative metric?
    - [ ] Number of searches now vs before?
    - [ ] Choice to use dark mode?
- [ ] **Qualatitive testing**
  - [ ] Survey for opted in users witht the new UI to ask what they think about it?
  - [ ] In person feedback

### How a decision will be made

**Negative key metrics** 
- Investigate why and follow up 

**Same or positive key metrics** 
- Still investigate why (we don't want to be overly confident based on metrics alone) but move forward with rollout

**User feedback**
- Differentiate between taste and functionality.
  - If people are actively havign a hard time to work with the UI / find what they want (especially new users) this is the kind of thing we should act on
