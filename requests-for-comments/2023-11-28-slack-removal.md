# Request for comments: Closing the PostHog Users Slack

This RFC is to explore the topic of potentially closing the PostHog Users Slack entirely. 

## Argument: Why would we close it?

The PostHog Users Slack currently exists in limbo. It was previously the main channel for getting customer feedback, chatting to users, fostering a community, and running community support. Now, however, we have better and more scalable methods for each of these - Surveys, user interviews, the Post/Questions section, and the support modal respectively. 

As we've introduced each of these tools, we've moved further from the Slack to the point that the user Slack is no longer referenced or linked to anywhere on the site, and team members admit they rarely check it. 

The same isn't true for users, a small ([but declining](/images/slack.png)) number of whom still use it almost universally for submitting support requests. Often these don't get a response from us (because it's not a support channel) or other users (because we've failed to foster a true community on Slack).

The result is that the Slack gives users a bad experience, while providing little to no benefit to us or them. There's no clear owner to make any changes, and so the argument is that closing will improve the user experience with little to no impact for the team. 

## Counterarguments: Why would we keep it?

Previously when I've raised this topic the argument has been that some teams use the Slack when dealing with users. Typically the argument has been that Customer Success can nurture clients through the Slack, that Engineering teams can get feedback and discuss contributions, and that Product/Marketing can use it for speaking with users directly. 

> I no longer thing this is the case, and that these conversations happen in other channels. Please comment if you feel differently, or have other arguments. 

A speculative argument to keep the Slack would be that we are planning to invest more in the PostHog community, and that we want to build a genuine network of users that are helping each other and sharing content. Currently Slack doesn't feature into those plans, however. 

## How would we close it?

If we were to close the Slack I'd create a more detailed action plan at the time, but essential steps would be: 

1. Announce publicly that we're closing the Slack, why, and when. Send an email to all active members from the last month. We would offer all active users a reward as thanks for feedback - say, Â£15 credit for the PostHog store. 
1. Set an initial date when users can respond, after which we'd plan to archive all channels in the Slack. 
1. A second date would mark the deletion of the Slack entirely. This would give users (and us) time to backup anything they may need and plan migrations from private channels. We direct all future comms to relevant platforms (Contributing = GitHub, Support = Questions, etc)
