# RFC: The future of HogMail is... ProductHog

HogMail was launched in April as a mostly PostHog orientated news drop. It’s since evolved into a more product growth-themed newsletter hybrid. We send it every two weeks – this won’t change.

This RFC sets out some ideas and discussion points for taking HogMail to the next level by treating it as a distinct brand and product, created by PostHog.

Most recent issue for context + feedback: [https://mailchi.mp/posthog/hogmail-15794324](https://mailchi.mp/posthog/hogmail-15794324)

## Where we are now

- Our subscriber list has grown 49% since April – 662 to 987 as of writing.
- Open rates have increased from ~43% at launch to ~47% to 50% now. Based on my research, this is above average but not market-leading for a newsletter of our type.
- Each issue is split into three sections: new PostHog articles, curated articles with commentary, misc. interesting reads.
- Most signups come via CTAs on the website and promotion in The Array
- At the current rate of growth, we’d reach 1,500 subscribers by the end of 2023

## Where we want to be

- 2,500 subs by end of 2023 – a 150% increase on today
- People sharing and recommending newsletter on social media
- Be a newsletter that’s perceived as a desirable source of promotion for content creators

## Proposal: Rebrand to ‘ProductHog’ and launch on Substack

- The current branding was a simple way to get started, but is limiting.
- ‘ProductHog’ implies what the newsletter is about, while still drawing a connection between it and PostHog.
- Actions: create website for ProductHog (we own the domain) and launch dedicated social channels.

### Why Substack?

Currently the newsletter is on Mailchimp, but we’ve recently migrated other email ops to [Customer.io](http://Cusomter.io). 

I’m proposing Substack because:

- It’s a popular platform people know and like
- It would make this feel distinct from other “marketing emails”
- Allows us to tap into the Substack network effects to aid growth

The downsides of Substack:

- We’ll have less control over branding and appearance
- **Important:** Substack’s [official embeddable signup form](https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041759232-Can-I-embed-a-signup-form-for-my-publication-) is very limited – it’s not customisable and there’s no public API or any sign they’re going to support one. [Viable workarounds](https://docs.substackapi.com/) may exist, but this is a major downside. The default Substack signup box (I believe) redirects people to Substack’s website as a result. Is this an acceptable trade-off for Substack’s network effects?

If not Substack, we’ll move to [Customer.io](http://Customer.io) as originally planned.

### Who is ProductHog for?

As is currently the case, it’ll be closely aligned to our ICP and target in order of importance:

- CEOs and founders
- Product engineers
- Product managers and product owners
- Growth hackers and product marketers

### Who is ProductHog NOT for?

- Indie hackers (they may find it useful, but it won’t be tailored to their interests)
- Marketing teams (even when we discuss marketing adjacent topics)
- Traditional “unengaged” engineers
- Data scientists

## How to 10x ProductHog

### Make each issue more thematic

Currently, each issue is a bit of a mishmash of different topics and ideas. This provides variety, but not much focus. Curation should still be a core part of the newsletter, but ideally each issue should be more like a magazine, where the core content is themed around a particular topic or idea.

### Double down on curation

In addition to more focused original content, we should become known as a leading source for curated articles on product growth and high-growth startups. This means having more curated articles and (likely) adding categories to organise them more clearly for readers.

### De-emphasise PostHog specific tutorials

Having a high emphasis on content about doing specific things in PostHog will put off people who aren’t already PostHog users. Our goal with ProductHog is to raise awareness of PostHog and promote our values, rather than inform existing users of new content / how to stuff. We should launch a new email list / create a new way to alert PostHog users to new tutorials.

### Introduce a regular feature(s)

Open to suggestions here, but I was thinking we could do something around highlighting an interesting company / product each issue. It would help us with mutual promotion of the newsletter. Could be primarily focused on users of PostHog, but not exclusively. This would have to be freelanced as an ongoing commission to reduce load. 

**Challenge:** How to avoid this becoming cookie-cutter, boring marketing guff – i.e. interview with so-and-so about “something only they care about”?

### Introduce guest contributors

I’d like to start commissioning guest contributors from well-known and successful newsletters in our space, either to write pieces for us or collaborate on articles with James on topics of mutual interest to our audiences. This might get expensive, but would be more valuable than a simple sponsorship.

### Paid promotion

Once we’re in a decent place, we should test some paid promotion of the newsletter on Twitter and LinkedIn. This needs be done carefully to avoid poor quality signups.

### Get more PostHog users to signup

Only a tiny fraction of PostHog users subscribe to the current newsletter, and likely many are unaware of it. We’ve previously ruled out promotion during onboarding (for good reasons), but we could do with a better solution here.
