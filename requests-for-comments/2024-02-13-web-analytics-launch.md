## Web analytics marketing launch plan

The launch date for web analytics isn't nailed down yet, but it's _seeming_ like it'll be in March. Either way, it's never too early to plan for how we'll market the heck out it. 

It's worth noting that Web Analytics has been in opt-in beta for some time too, so we can rely on this group of beta-testing customers as an additional launch asset!

We have some [new best practices for product launches around templates](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/development-process#best-practices-for-full-releases), but these mostly do not apply to web analytics due to its scope. 

## Pricing?

Pricing is TBC, but web analytics will have usage-based pricing.
