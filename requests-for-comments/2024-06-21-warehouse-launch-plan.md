## [Marketing] Data warehouse launch plan

The data warehouse has been in an opt-in beta for a while, and has now been opened up to a public open beta. It'll be at least a few weeks before it launches (we need to give current users two weeks notice of pricing changes) BUT that means it's the perfect time to plan. 

### Ahead of launch

- [x] Publish a [Stripe data warehouse tutorial](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/8662) - Marketing
- [x] Publish a [Hubspot data warehouse tutorial](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/8664) - Marketing
- [ ] Publish a [Zendesk data warehouse tutorial](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/8663) - Marketing
- [ ] Create dashboard templates for 2x common usecases - @ivanagas

### Bigger ideas

**Dashboard Templates**
Is it possible to create dashboard templates that integrate with our integrated sources? E.g. a dashboard for getting Stripe data. 

**Discount Pricing**
We could offer discounted pricing for the first year to all users who have connected a source during the beta. Easy way to get good will and retain these users - and, if announced early, encourage some early adopters. 

**Data warehouse as a newsletter theme**
I've learned not to suggest anything too specific here. But talking about data warehouses in the newsletter is a way to get attention.  

**Sponsorships**
There are some newsletter sponsorships we've looked at before, such as DataElixir, which may be a good match for this audience. We could draw up a list of podcasts and newsletters to reach to ahead of time. (Suggestions welcome)

**Integrate with upcoming PR announcement**
Being coy on details in this public repo, but have raised with James directly for discussion. 

**ProductHunt Launch**
Not really, don't worry Charles.
