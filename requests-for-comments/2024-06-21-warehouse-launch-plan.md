## [Marketing] Data warehouse launch plan

The data warehouse has been in an opt-in beta for a while, and has now been opened up to a public open beta. It'll be at least a few weeks before it launches (we need to give current users two weeks notice of pricing changes) BUT that means it's the perfect time to plan. 

### Ahead of launch

- [ ] Publish a Stripe data warehouse tutorial - Marketing
- [ ] Publish a Hubspot data warehouse tutorial - Marketing
- [ ] Publish a Postgres data warehouse tutorial - Marketing
- [ ] Update docs as needed - Marketing
- [ ] Add Data Warehouse to in-app 'Explore the docs' menu - @joethreepwood
- [x] Key art - @lottiecoxon (we have some already, open to new though)


### Launch day activity

- [ ] Publish a launch blog piece about why data warehouse is important - 
- [ ] Update pricing page with data warehouse pricing
- [ ] Update in-app onboarding with data warehouse option
- [ ] Share blogpost to HackerNews - Marketing
- [ ] Email announcement to all users - @joethreepwood
- [ ] Social push, changelog, Pylon announcement - @joethreepwood
- [ ] Bookface launch to the YC community - @jamesefhawkins 

### Follow-on activity

- [ ] Source a data warehouse customer story - @joethreepwood
- [ ] Update onboarding email flow with data warehouse options - @joethreepwood

### Bigger ideas

**Dashboard Templates**
Is it possible to create dashboard templates that integrate with our integrated sources? E.g. a dashboard for getting Stripe data. 

**Discount Pricing**
We could offer discounted pricing for the first year to all users who have connected a source during the beta. Easy way to get good will and retain these users - and, if announced early, encourage some early adopters. 

**Data warehouse as a newsletter theme**
I've learned not to suggest anything too specific here. But talking about data warehouses in the newsletter is a way to get attention. 

**Invite Theo to try it**
We could invite Theo to try the data warehouse and talk about his thoughts. He could have someone to interview, etc., if he wants. 

**Sponsorships**
There are some newsletter sponsorships we've looked at before, such as DataElixir, which may be a good match for this audience. We could draw up a list of podcasts and newsletters to reach to ahead of time. (Suggestions welcome)

**Integrate with upcoming PR announcement**
Being coy on details in this public repo, but have raised with James directly for discussion. 

**ProductHunt Launch**
Not really, don't worry Charles.
