# Podcast feedback

This document is an exhaustive aggregate of all the feedback we received from recording initial episodes of our PostHog podcast. It's intended to turn all that feedback into actionable takeaways and a list of decisions we need to make about the direction for future episodes.

For context, we set out to produce a podcast as part of our Q1 marketing goals. But there has been some internal debate about whether we should:

- soft launch and iterate over time to produce higher quality (see the parable about how [quantity leads to quantity](https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable)), or...
- continue producing internal-only episodes as we improve the content until it's good enough to launch publicly

## Decisions

- Should we release any of the content we have so far?
  - Recommendation: Aggressively edit the content from the episodes with Cory and Raquel. We have about 50 minutes for each episode, but we can cut out content that didn't land and try to aim for tighter episodes closer to 20 minutes in length that are made up of the best content we recorded.
- Should we do audio and video? Or consider starting with audio only?
  - Recommendation: Starting with both audio and video was likely a mistake since we ended up with too many variables to worry about. Having said that, my recommendation is that we stick with both. Part of the original goals for the podcast were to open the door to video content and work towards improving our ability to produce video content internally.
- Should we have separate edits for audio and video?
  - Recommendation: Long term, definitely. But in the short term, we should focus on aggressively editing content and keeping it tight even if the video versions end up feeling a bit janky.
- How long should each episode be?
  - Recommendation: The shorter the better. We should aim for 10-20 minutes, with a maximum of 30 minutes only if we have a ton of great content.
- What should we name the show? Something obvious like Product Engineering?
  - Recommendation: I prefer "The Product Engineering Podcast" since it's obvious in terms of the value proposition. But a lot of people liked "Quick Calls with Jimmy Hawkins" and I don't feel strongly either way.
- Should the content lean towards boring/valuable or entertaining? Should we try to make it personal? I've tried to find a fun segment to ask "name something weird" or a recommend a book or show. Should we just stay on topic?
  - Recommendation: This sounds obvious that we want content that's clearly valuable to listeners. But the answer here will dictate a lot of the episode content. Do we want to get to know the people behind the product? Do we want to share stories about how PostHog and the products have come together? Or should we script a topic and try to stay on it as much as possible? I generally lean towards us creating a podcast that follows the success of our newsletter with a clear value proposition. "Here's how to do X topic based on our lived experience and lessons learned at PostHog." The drawback is that the conversations could get visibly boring if we try to stick to a script too tightly.
- How do we balance the quirky, fun tone with serious content?
  - Recommendation: We have an over-the-top jingle and potentially a puppet in the branding for the show. But the conversations are "fundamentally a business talk". We can potentially balance the two, but it can admittedly come across as awkward and make the content seem dull when the fast-paced intro segues into a conversation.
- How long should we schedule for recording?
  - Recommendation: Our existing 60 minute block works well for now. If we have external guests, we should try to get more content by extending to 90 minutes, where the first ~20 minutes is a pre-interview.
- Should Bijan host the show?
  - Recommendation: We likely have a lot of people internally at PostHog that would be better at hosting. If Bijan continues to host, he'll have to rapidly improve at asking questions and directing the conversations.
- Should we continue with the podcast as a goal?
  - Recommendation: This is a meta question, but it's worth asking. We have excellent written and social content. But it seems like we've struggled with audio and video content. Part of the reason for the podcast was to make an intentional effort to improve in this area. But it's conceivable that we're not currently well-suited to creating this kind of content. And if that's the case, it's worth considering pivoting away from the goal before sinking additional resources into it.

## Lessons learned and actionable takeaways

- Intros
  - Start each episode with 1-2 highlights. What is the most counterintuitive thing anyone said?
  - Intros are critical. The host should rehearse the intro until it sounds smooth. If you make a mistake, start over instead of continuing past it.
  - Introduce the show, the topic, and the guests. We tried long intros, short intros, and no intro. There definitely _needs_ to be an intro, but it should be as concise as possible.
- Cadence
  - Release one episode every other week, alternating with the newsletter release.
- Hosting and interviewing
  - Ask short, direct questions. Long questions lead to long, verbose answers.
  - Ask one question at a time. If you ask multiple questions, guests will have to figure out which to respond to.
  - If there are multiple guests, ask questions to a specific guest. Otherwise there will be an awkward pause about who should respond.
  - It needs to be clear and obvious who is hosting.
  - Ask follow up questions to dive deeper, rather than just moving on to the next topic.
- Content
  - Avoid "this is what we did at PostHog" content. Instead, content should follow this format: "We did this... and this is how you should think about the problem more broadly."
- Tone
  - Avoid coming across as salesy. If you notice the word "PostHog" is coming up 100x in an episode, you did something wrong.
- Audio
  - Check audio levels _before_ recording. Using postprocessing tools can mangle the audio.
- Video
  - Show the person actively speaking, not everyone at the same time.
  - Video shouldn't be an afterthought. If we're releasing both audio and video versions of the podcast, the video version should take advantage of the format and include things like showing visuals when relevant. For example, if Cory is talking about the PostHog website, we should show it.
- Editing
  - Edit aggressively, but don't overdo it. We tried episodes with minimal editing (with Cory and James) and the feedback was that it was too long and not fast paced enough. We tried episodes where we edited every "uh" and "um" and the video became too "jumpy." The takeaway is we need to edit aggressively between sentences and segments, but not strip out mid-sentence pauses.
  - Split episodes into segments. See [Dalton & Michael](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ-uHSnFig5Nd98Sc9I-kkc0ZWe8peRMC) for good examples of this.
- Variables
  - When testing new ideas, it's best to isolate variables. We may have been better off recording a single episode topic three times and then releasing the last, best version instead of recording several different topics and varying several different things for each episode.

## Raw collected feedback

This is a giant list of all the feedback we received bucketed into categories.

### Launch

- we can big bang launch or launch iteratively. newsletter worked -  we just iterated. the latter works every time for us and the quality comes with time. I propose we launch with [episode 3]. I propose this is a soft launch so we don't go nuts marketing it. Maybe put it in the next newsletter and as a blog post for example, just go from there. (James)
- Having listened to the episode now, I 100% think we shouldn’t launch with this one. I left my feedback on the specific thread, but the topic is probably the weakest one so far. (Andy)
- we should launch it as audio only and do video later. There’s no reason to launch WITH video and it makes editing way harder. With audio only, we can cut up stuff as we please and not have to worry about continuity + camera setups etc. Once we “get good” at the audio version, we can do a big launch with a video version. (Andy)
- Doing a quick prototype with internal people and the full intent not to release it at all is often the quickest way to get opinions on this stuff. (Joe)

### Segmentation

- Split episodes into segments with breaks in between (Cory)
- some kind of interstitial sequence for youtube but not for spotify etc. could just be a slide or something with the audio playing behind it (like the 2 sec posthog jingle). this would call out the topics and then in the description we can link like 10:12 to "why we didn't copy Linear" for example + it would give it more energy. we could play with Bijan "announcing" each topic inbetween for the audio for spotify (James)

### Editing

- the editing vibe is crisp and quick, though sometimes feels a tad jumpy (Kevan)
- Doing video and having a highly edited experience seem a bit at odds with each other. Watching in a video just makes the number of cuts really obvious. Feel like we either have a tightly edited audio podcast with no video, or a looser more conversational experience but with video. (Andy)
- Edits are less obvious / obtrusive than before, which is cool. This works as a video now. (Andy)
- We should use something like descript to remove filler words. I personally have far less patience for slowness when listening to audio - yes I can increase the speed but that speeds it all up, it doesn't just speed through the fillers. (Raquel)
- We should cut aggressively, no fades or anything. Tiktok/youtube style is what people will expect and doing anything else feels dated. (Raquel)

### Intros

- Start the episode with 1-2 highlight moments
- Jump straight in. Avoid long intros. (Joe)
- Have an edited section of highlights at the start of the podcast (Andy)
- Write an intro script and rehearse it.
- the host, so you should be introducing the topic / setting the context, not James. This sets the tone for the whole podcast, really. It feels like James is driving from the backseat. Intro it like this is something we’re going to publish. (Andy)
- Really plan the intro. Script it and practice it beforehand until it feels natural. (Andy)
- You don’t introduce yourself or James, or set much context about the topic or story. Assume the listener knows nothing about PostHog and its pivots and go from there. What context do listeners need to understand the whole story? (Andy)
- I noticed I was doing a shit job of having an off-the-cuff introduction to the episodes and guests. So I tried writing a script and recording a prepared intro for this episode. (Bijan)
- I think you could skip all that early boilerplate. Just say the name of the show, the topic, and the guests. think about how you could land an early hook. A format I really like is a cold open that frontloads a really good point, funny quip, or moment of disagreement that shows up later in the episode (Danilo)
- some kind of intro sequence. we want to film one Feb 6th with  @Lottie as the puppet will be done then but that is a couple of weeks away, may not work well and will take time after that to get it right. we animate one now (using @Cory Watilo’s buddy, assuming he can be quick) then improve it with above - I'd propose this (James)
- The opening nuggets bit seemed boring (‘challenge the status quo’, generic advice from James) when I compare it to the excellent clickbait Lenny uses for his - ie. what is the most counterintuitive thing anyone said? I actually liked Cory’s quote about neglecting his side projects as an example, but there are plenty of others. (Charles)
- It’s not obvious to me what the dynamic is here from the editing, like is Bijan the host and he’s asking people stuff? Or is it James? Without the context, it feels like I’ve randomly dropped in on 3 people.
- Why am I 5 mins in and there’s been no intro yet? (Joe)

### Show notes

- Use the [Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/confessions-of-a-big-tech-recruiter) as an example of a concise summary, takeaways, and relevant links.

### Jingle

- I really, really hate that jingle. It’s abrupt, and far too...much. It doesn’t match to the tone of the chat and what is fundamentally a business talk. (Joe)

### Entertainment

- Conversations should be exciting (Joe)

### Audio

- Check audio levels before episodes (normalizing audio afterward can create some distortion). (Bijan)
- Selectively mute the non-speaker. (Bijan)
- Have a pop filter if you’re going to be saying PostHog, podcast, and pivots often. (Bijan)
- Be wary of the AI audio enhancement option (Bijan)
- Audio starts good, but starts to go wrong around 6mins. Unsure if it’s a editing or equipment issue, but James’ audio starts to become somewhat clipped and poppy around the 6 min mark and continues throughout. Need to figure this out. (Andy)

### Video

- I guess editing wise there are long stretches of one person talking and two people trying to not look dead behind the eyes. I think I’ve seen other videos where the spotlight is just on the person talking. (Charles)
- For episode 2, Bijan audio and visual is perfect (Andy)
- Good framing on both sides. Not so much dead space like before
- James looks a little washed out (episode 2). Could do with some warmer lighting. Looks like a ghost.
- video should only be one person at a time, otherwise you end up just looking at the other person doing nothing while the one person talks.
- For the video stream each person's eyes should be at the top 1/3 of the screen - your eyes should not be on the center line. (Raquel)
- 17 mins in, Cory starts talking about previous versions of the site. That feels like an opportunity to use video-in-video or overlay those previous versions. If we’re releasing this as audio and video then we need to limit the amount of visual references, but video is always going to feel like an unpopular afterthought unless we take advantage of the format. (Joe)
- There's lots of opportunity to cut to slides or screensharing.

### Guests

- James’s camera was probably a bit too zoomed in and you both had too much dead space above your heads. Video looked pretty good otherwise.
- The video/audio setup you created is amazing, Bijan. I see the effort in background, lighting, camera, mic, apparel; you've thought through things sooo carefully.
- Try to keep everyone’s eyeline in the top 1/3rd of the screen. Not too much space above your head.
- For external guests, interview the the guest beforehand to the host already kind of knows what they think. This lets you prepare the questions to hit specific points. (Andy)
- If we’re going to show multiple faces at once then they should all be scaled to match. James looks tiny. (Joe)
- We really can’t stick with the three-face-shot for the whole video. We should change it up at points to focus on who is talking/listening. On TV, the camera angle changes every 12s on average.
- Cory is a great video guest because he’s physically expressive. If we capture video we want guests like this, who use their hands. James feels very static by comparison. (Joe)

### Hosting and interviewing

- Imagine you’re planning a long journey. You have a destination, but also have waypoints along the way you want to arrive at. It’s ok to take detours between the waypoints, but you should always work your way back to them. (Andy)
- Ask short, direct questions (avoid asking multiple questions at once)
- If there are multiple guests, ask to a specific person (otherwise it takes a second for guests to figure out who should answer) (Charles)
- If and when you’re doing an interview, it’s important to ask direct questions. There was a lot of “talk about this for a bit” kind of moments. (Andy)
- Meandering questions from Bijan. Sometimes I was asking several questions at once instead of one at a time. (Bijan and Ian)
- It's important to have a consistent host (Joe)
- It wasn't obvious who was hosting even right as we were about to record an episode (Raquel)
- You’ve already identified this, but long questions aren’t great and they encourage long answers as well. You asked a question at 6 mins and James finished answering at 13 mins (Andy)
- Only ask questions. Part of the issue around long questions is you’re trying to add your own context and thoughts, but resist this. You’re the listener’s surrogate. When James is talking, the only thing you should be thinking about is what question you should follow-up on, or things you want James to go deeper on. It should feel like you’re pushing James to think harder.
- Interrupt sometimes. You’re kind of just waiting for your turn to speak. If there’s a point that’s not clear, or needs further exploration, jump in and ask a clarifying question. (Andy)
- Ask questions you know the answer to. Especially with this topic, we’ve written about this a lot, so you should have question queued up that you know James will answer in a specific way. This also means you can steer the conversation in a specific direction – see earlier points about waypoints.
- Ask questions you know James will disagree with. “No, I disagree and this is why” is a more interesting response than something more general – e.g. “People often say you should validate ideas before you start building them. Do you agree?” or “It’s important to validate ideas before building them, right?” is better than asking “How do you validate ideas before building them?” or “How long does it take to validate ideas?”
- Mostly did this, but Bijan when you’re asking questions, direct them at a single person (Charles)
- Basically we should frame the conversation with questions that enable us to not just talk specifically about PostHog. (Joe)
- With James especially, I think you may need to get comfortable interjecting and refocusing the conversation (Joe)
- Generally, I think we can do a better job at driving for depth on topics. (instead of moving on to the next idea or topic) (Joe)
- 36 mins in and, again, I feel we could improve things by policing and focusing the conversation better. The topic is supposed to be ‘How not to be boring’, but instead James is talking about why we don’t have deadlines. (Joe)

### Content and format

- take the newsletter and do an audio deep dive version of it (Joe)
- "So many podcasts interview people about their successes, and it can get a bit tiresome. PostHog seems to be about learning — about shipping quickly, failing fast, iterating. Transparently and openly. What if there was a podcast that focused more on learning through failures, rather than just highlighting stories of success?" Flounders: founders sharing stories of failures. (Kevan)
- I feel like an episode with both James and Tim would make a good “launch” podcast. Perhaps “our biggest mistakes” would be a good theme? I’m sure we could come up with a list and James and Tim could talk about each with more detail. (Andy)
  - James and Tim have a terrific chemistry and they have legitimately fascinating stories to tell. people love to hear about the pain and the growth (Danilo)
  - I'm trying to think about how we could frame this in a way that's useful to listeners. (Bijan)
    - Erm, I’d avoid overthinking it too much. James and Tim come up with a list of mistakes. Pick the best ones. Discuss each one and ask questions about them. (Andy)
- Split episodes into segments and have buffers between them (Cory)
- I'm trying to think about how we could frame this in a way that's useful to listeners. (Bijan)
- We can probably scope way down for podcast episodes. Like "How to validate product ideas" is actually a huge topic that we could split into several smaller sub-episodes, and I think we tried to cover a ton of ground in this short 40 minutes. (Bijan)
- This was a big improvement on the first attempt. (Andy)
- Episode 2 Agree this was a good topic to cover, but after about 10 mins I’d kind of forgotten what the podcast was meant to be about. (Andy)
- The biggest win was coming up with a topic that is genuinely valuable for our intended listening audience (founders, product engineers). And framing the episode content from the perspective of what they would want to know. (Bijan)
- Episode 2 Agree with opportunities for improvement, but the content was interesting (Ian)
- It's hard to find content that's genuinely useful for practitioners. (Annika)
- Dalton and Michael for YC who are so freaking good at this type of interview (Charles)
- The refugee on boats story does not land and makes James sound like a bit of an asshole (sorry) - you’d need to amp it up more to sound genuinely funny, but it doesn’t have enough conviction behind it so just sounds a bit ‘lol we’re so tone deaf’ and peters out. (Charles)
- The general section from 30ish mins onwards where Cory talks about the site in more detail is good stuff - this is the meat. (Charles)
- **I think generally I would have liked more ‘we did this and then this is how you should think about this problem more broadly’, rather than ‘this is what we did at PostHog’. Maybe you could use titles or something overlaid to show this.** (Charles)
- **Basically we should frame the conversation with questions that enable us to not just talk specifically about PostHog.** (Joe)
- Generally you guys got into the flow way more as time went on, especially 30min onwards. I feel like this is probably a 25min video if you edit out the cruft. (Charles)
- I’m 15 mins in and it’s so far felt very salesy because it’s James and Cory talking about PostHog. I really strongly think we want to avoid this angle, even with external guests. For this topic I think it’d be more interesting to go deep with Cory on his influences, iterations, art process, mistakes, etc. (Joe)
- A key thing I always try to bear in mind when editing things is that conflict is the source of all interest. People talking about what they do well is only really interesting in terms of conflict (e.g. what they overcame or fought against). (Joe)
- **James talking about defying the pareto principle is really great. Talking about this and the DPA would have been a really strong starting point for the whole show. I love how Cory picks up this conversation and goes further with it.**
- interviewing people from the YC and Startups program (Joe)
- revisit case studies and interview PostHog customers (Joe)

### Length

This feels like a good length, though I lost of interest around the 20 min mark. (Andy)
I feel like this is probably a 25min video if you edit out the cruft. (Charles)
This is 50 minutes long? That feels way, way too long to me. 30 mins is the max for me (Joe)

### Recording cadence

- Biweekly episodes that fit in between our newsletter releases (Andy)
- I love the idea that we can nail down a solid weekly schedule early on. I think the plan for the long-term is to do biweekly episodes, but more is better up front so we can learn a lot quickly. I also think it's valuable for us to have a good process for quickly being able to record, edit, get internal feedback, collect show notes, and assemble supporting materials. (Bijan)

### Art, photography, and assets

- for thumbnails, think about using a simple grid to ground your layout. when elements line up (perhaps the top edge of the image and the top edge of the logo) they appear more satisfying and coherent (Danilo)
- We can do more suit photos or could get some better props than a whiteboard for pics like untangling wired headphones, trophy with ‘worlds okayest podcaster’, holding cue card with something funnier than ‘pause for dramatic effect’ etc. May not be for thumbnail but unspecific content for podcast promo (Scott)
- I'm gonna do some research on some cool podcast designs + have spoken to James about using the 6th Feb shoot to get some content (maybe with puppet) (Lottie)

### Naming

- See [Slack poll](https://posthog.slack.com/archives/C02E3BKC78F/p1736867787297179) for results
- personally Quick calls has more personality and sounds cooler  - isn't limited to just product engineering - could range to more startup/business/ anything content PLUS you can put 'with so and so' at the end of it when we have new guests (Lottie)
- It’s a neat name because it has two meanings: the original quip from James’s shitposting. and a fast decision making metabolism that startups need to win (Danilo)
- sorry just my $0.02 i also love quick calls (Cory)
- It’s probably in the ballpark, but I’m cooling on the whole “Quick Call” name tbh. (Andy)
