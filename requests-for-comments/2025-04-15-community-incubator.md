# Request for comments: PostHog Builder Community Incubator

Decider: Ian

Decision date: April 25

## Problem

We know we want to do events at PostHog.

- We’ve been talking about doing more for over a year.
- We are hiring someone to “do events”
- It’s going to be their goal to create 500 superfans.

The problem is we don’t really know what types of events we want to do. We’ve partnered on and sponsored some events, but nothing of our own. The standard options don’t really work for what we want to do.

1. **Casual meetup:** Doesn’t create super fans and we want to encourage building, not networking.
2. **Accelerator:** Won’t get to 500 super fans quick enough. There are a lot of other accelerators to go through. 
3. **Conferences:** Too expensive and undifferentiated, basically the event version of a whitepaper. 

Our best option is “hackathons” and we’ve seen some good results partnering with other companies on (such as the [ElevenLabs hackathon](https://hackathon.elevenlabs.io/)).

The tricky part about hackathons is that PostHog as a product is fundamentally not a good fit with hackathons. You don’t use PostHog to build the v0 of a product, you use it to build version 0.1. This is a different position to companies like ElevenLabs and Supabase who’s events we look up to. 

We also want something “we would actually want to go to.” So what should this be?

## Solution: The PostHog Builder Community Incubator

Inspired by “something we’d actually want to go to,” I thought about the events I have actually wanted to go to and there’s one that comes to mind: [Novus](https://www.novus.build/). 

Novus is a weekly builder meetup in Vancouver that happens every Saturday. It’s 3 hours, starting with a quick round of intros, then 2.5 hours of building, and then demos at the end. It attracts exactly the type of people PostHog wants to appeal to: builders working on startups, prototypes, and side projects.

I see Novus as part of a larger [distributed builder culture](https://ianv.substack.com/p/distributing-builder-culture) with more examples like [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) (RIP), [Socratica](https://www.socratica.info/) (who filled a 2500 person stadium to watch demos [a few weeks ago](https://betakit.com/the-future-of-canadian-tech-runs-through-waterloo/)), and more. Socratica has encouraged [a bunch of these to pop-up](https://www.socratica.info/map), but there could be WAYYYY more, especially outside of big North American cities.

### So what does this have to do with PostHog?

We should help make more of these types of events happen. Reasons: 

1. No one else is.
2. It’s a better fit for us than hackathons are.
3. It will help us create local groups of super fans around the world.

What can we do to make them happen? **Provide the activation energy.** These events require three things, each of which we can help with: 

1. **A host.** We can give someone interested a grant ($$$) to get started then let them run it afterwards. This also makes sure they are aligned with us early. It’s sort of like a community accelerator. 
2. **A location.** We can reach out to our networks and customers, provide guidance on how to find a venue. These events are nearly always reliant on “free” space, but take place on the evenings and weekends when there is often space available. 
3. **Attendees.** We social post about events happening, have an event page on posthog.com, help the host find attendees. 

## Next steps

- Wait for Joe to get back Tuesday April 22 to hear his thoughts.
- Decide whether to do it now or wait.
- Ian to ask Fraser if we can actually pay people money to do this? We have an “event budget” we can use on it.
- Ian preps requirements:
    - Guide to hosting, use Socratica [toolbox as a blueprint](https://toolbox.socratica.info/) but also details on reaching out to spaces, marketing, setting up events page, intros, demos, etc.
    - PostHog assets, description, and links to use in marketing.
    - Send community merch airdrop?
- James tweets “We will pay you $800 to host a builder meetup in your city for the next four weeks.”
- Tell them:
    1. Run a **new** builder meetup (cowork + demos) 
    2. Get at least 10 people to come. Post about it. 
    3. We’ll send you money.
    4. You’ve now bootstrapped a community, keep it going.
- Hand this off to events person when they start
