# RFC: Should we start a second newsletter focused on AI for engineers?

> **Note:** This is quite a speculative RFC, I more want to get the idea out there and have discussion about its potential.

Our Product for Engineers newsletter is one of the most important pieces of marketing we do. It is the most direct way we get our brand and ideas to our audience. Each newsletter gets 35k views immediately (like a blog going viral) and we get 125-175k views per month on Substack. This converts ok to `posthog.com`, 52 org signups in [the last 6 months](https://us.posthog.com/project/2/insights/FKjf0kZF), better than any of the influencers, and a decent amount of [orgs are paying us](https://us.posthog.com/project/2/insights/HeqPwhmM).

(Sidenote: I want to do more research about how successful the newsletter actually is).

We’ve been talking about the future of the newsletter and how to scale it, so I thought I would throw this out there: Should we start a second newsletter? 

The portfolio approach seems like the common way many successful, internet-native media companies expand. For example, each of these companies has multiple newsletter covering multiple 

- [1440](https://join1440.com/)
- [TheSkimm](https://www.theskimm.com/newsletters)
- [Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/)
- [Pirate Wires](https://www.piratewires.com/newsletters)

Multiple newsletter expands you potential audience, increases the potential topic area, enables cross-promotion, while still benefiting the main brand. We can get more bang for our buck on advertising and duplicate a lot of our promotion playbook for it too. 

If yes, an **AI engineering newsletter** seems like the way to go for three reasons:

1. Like “doing product” as an engineer has become so important, “doing AI” has become just as important (if not more). I’ve especially seen this as I’ve researched how our team uses AI tools. Utilizing AI tools and building AI features has rapidly become a core part in “equipping every developer to build successful products.”
2. We’re increasingly being drawn to AI newsletters to writing AI newsletters like [An engineer's guide to vibe design (with prompts)](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/an-engineers-guide-to-vibe-design), How [REDACTED](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/issues/12053) was built (upcoming) How to build AI-powered features (upcoming), and How product engineers use AI (upcoming).
3. Many of the most popular newsletters on Substack focus on AI for engineers including [Nate’s Newsletter](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/), [Understanding AI](https://www.understandingai.org/), [TheSequence](https://thesequence.substack.com/), [LatentSpace](https://www.latent.space/), [Elevate](https://addyo.substack.com/), [Ahead of AI](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/). 

A big benefit of an AI engineering newsletter is that it can be much more news-focused. This is something others have been keen on and has been mentioned nearly every time we talk about increasing the frequency of the newsletter, but I’ve been skeptical. News can much more naturally be a part of an AI newsletter than a product engineering one IMO and a lot of the existing AI newsletters do it well. 

## What do we need to launch another newsletter?

Assuming we want the same once every two weeks cadence as we have for Product for Engineers, we would we need would need to hire one more person to basically write newsletters full time. We basically have 1.5 content marketers’ worth of time on Product Engineers. All of us could contribute there too, but we’d need someone else who could contribute consistently too. 

Second, we’d need a brand for it. We’d need a name, design, style, etc. We can work with the Brand team on this.

Third, we’d need some way to grow it. Of course, we can copy and paste the email list but I feel like this is sort of a faux pas. There is some obvious ones: sharing links, referring it, adding both to our signup form, running ads to it. 

Most importantly here I think would be:

- Default to double opting-in people on [PostHog.com](http://PostHog.com) for both newsletters so any subs we acquire there are subscribed to both.
- Crossposting the new newsletter’s posts in Product for Engineers indefinitely (when relevant). In this way, we can sort of “double dip” content too.

Fourth, we’d need content. As I touched on earlier, we are being drawn to writing this sort of content. The combination of our team being active users of AI, building AI features, having AI-focused customers, and the ability to use AI news makes me confident we have enough here to write about.
