We have a [content-marketing strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MLl49A5xqdy6BlmpyzLBxx6564NrToxBqe2JCcr9ono/edit#), and I've a few questions - feel free to add your own:

- You are proposing we write a lot and the impact will take a while. Should we immediately outsource the keyword-oriented content whilst managing the themes and topics in house? Have you seen this gone well or badly? Any advice? We can see how it's not a good idea for backlink / brand generating content.
- When do we do a pillar piece? When it feels natural? For higher volume keywords with lots of related ones? Can we have too many pillars?
